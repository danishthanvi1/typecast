# typesystem

An abstract type system, inspired by Freebase. ``typesystem`` can be
used to describe a type hierarchy of classes with attributes and
inheritance.

This was factored out of ``nomenklatura`` to become re-usable. See the [MQL
documentation](https://developers.google.com/freebase/mql/ch02#id2944699)
for the intended functionality.
